# WebComponentsPOC
The Proof Of Concept of our literature review for our IT Project.

## Iframe
The module made with old school iframes, there is only one because it does not scale well.

## Script
The module made with old school javascript, this is rendered afther load of the page so SEO is not the best.

## Component
The module made with Web Components.

### Vanilla
Web components implemented in vanilla javascript, this is not that user friendly since the the HTML and CSS are inline.

### Vue
Web components implemented in vue.js, this is very easy to work with end has almost no downsides.
